# System Feedback Report

This document summarizes the identified issues, errors, and improvement suggestions for different modules of the system.

---

## 🏨 Hotel Booking
- The website is unresponsive.  
- Some buttons are not functional.  
- The text is too small.  
- The header buttons (Home, Rooms, About, Services, & Contact) need improvement.   
- In the payment details, only GCash, Maya, and Credit Card are available—other options like Visa should also be supported.   

---

## 💻 Computer Laboratory Inventory
- The input value should be adjustable, but when entered, it did not update.  
- There was an error with the quantity — it would not increase to 2.  
- An error modal should pop up every time there is a window error.  
- Text should be displayed in a standard font size for better readability.  
- The report should have an option to switch between **landscape** and **portrait** orientation to display the full content properly.

## 🗳️ Voting System
- The vote limit is set as static (e.g., fixed at 1) when adding positions. This should be adjustable.  
- A bug prevents adding or inputting a candidate.  
- The **“Today”** button in the calendar is unresponsive (cannot be clicked).  
- The system cannot create a new election. An error occurs whenever a user attempts to add or request one.  
- The **“+ Request Election”** button is too large and needs resizing for better UI balance.

## 📚 Library Management
- A restriction (filter or “trap”) should be added so that students cannot use the AI to search for topics that are not related to their course.  
- There should be an **accreditation feature in PACUCOA** to ensure compliance with academic quality standards.  

---

## 📝 Grading Module
- The system should notify the **Registrar** when grade locking is in progress.  
- The **Super Admin** should have the ability to reset grade locking in case it reaches its limit.  
- In the user interface, the fields for **Subject, Semester, and Quarter** should be displayed inside proper input boxes for clarity and consistency.
